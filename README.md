# Intro

Hi, there! As a student pursuing a CCNA cert, I would love to share my path and maybe my writeups help you as well, who knows. &#x20;

My primary source of preparation is Jeremy's "Free CCNA 200-301" course ([link](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLxbwE86jKRgMpuZuLBivzlM8s2Dk5lXBQ)). I started blogging to confirm my understanding of the concepts and to serve as notes. As I will learn more in the future, it is gonna be quite overwhelming to remember everything and I will need a place to access everything covered so far in a short form.

The course is divided in the form of days. Each day new topic is covered. I will be dividing my blog in the same way so it's easier to follow. After each day there are some additional materials. I would strongly recommend using these additional materials to strengthen what will be covered in these writeups.&#x20;

<summary>Additional materials</summary>

1. In this course, Jeremy provides flashcard sets so we can easily review the materials afterwards. [Here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Atw8oMtVTA\&list=PLxbwE86jKRgMpuZuLBivzlM8s2Dk5lXBQ\&index=2) is how to download and use the Anki software.\
   I will be attaching these flashcard sets related to the topics covered at the end of each post. Or you can download all of them at once using Jeremy's [link](https://sendfox.com/jeremysitlab) provided.
2. To get some hands-on practice, there are also Packet Tracer labs after each topic. How to download and use Packet Tracer software is shown [here](https://youtu.be/a1Im6GYaSno). I will be attaching Jeremy's video on how to complete the lab and a lab file as well.

Hope you find my writeups useful and feel free to get in touch if you have any questions/suggestions!)
